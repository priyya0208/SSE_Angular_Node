<h4>Server-sent events</h4>
<p>Traditionally, a web page has to send a request to the server to receive new data; that is, the page requests data from the server. With server-sent events, it's possible for a server to send new data to a web page at any time, by pushing messages to the web page. These incoming messages can be treated as Events + data inside the web page.</p>

<h4>An Express server that sends one Server-Sent Event (SSE) per second, counting down from 10 to 0. Notification Badge is updating from api res.</h4>
